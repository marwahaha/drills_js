JQuery 		
filter() 
to define positive conditions each element has to fulfill	
after() to add an element as the next sibling	How to replace an element in jQuery? Just use the 
replaceWith() or the replaceAll() function. This lecture covers how to use both of them.	
.css()
.val( ) 
.attr() .prop() manipulating		

first() to get the first element from the selection	before() to add an element as the previous sibling	The difference between them is essentially the same as with prepend() and prependTo()	addClass() and removeClass() 
.html( )		last() to get the last element from the selection	append() to add an element as the last child		.data()
.text( )	Once you have a set of matched elements by using a CSS selector, you can further traverse the DOM tree to find the element you're looking for. Traversal function in jQuery include the following:	eq() to get an element from a specific position (can also take in negative numbers to start from back)	prepend() to add an element as the first child	.click()	you can use the on() function and pass in a space-separated list of events, like so:
fadeIn() fadeTo() fadeOut() 	find() to retrieve all descendant elements	not() to define negative conditions each element has to fulfill	appendTo() same effect as append() but with other syntax	hover()	$("#login").on("click keydown", function(event) { ... });
show() and hide() 	children() to retrieve only direct child elements		prependTo() same effect as prepend() but with other syntax	mouseenter() and mouseleave(). 	The .on() function will be important again when you learn about delegated events
slideUp() slideDown()	prev() to retrieve the previous sibling element				
slideToggle()	next() to retrieve the next sibling element		remove() to completely remove the element(s) from the page along with their associated data and event handlers		
animate()	parent() to retrieve the unique parent		detach() to remove the element(s) from the page but make jQuery remember their associated data and event handlers; this is useful if you want to reattach the element(s) to the page again later.		
$("header").delay(500).slideUp()	siblings() to retrieve all sibling elements		empty() to remove everything inside an element, including its children and text content.		
Activity	To restrict the elements selected during traversal, you can pass in selectors again. For example, $(":header").next("p") to find only paragraphs which follow directly after a heading.	jQuery's change() event is used for checkboxes, radio buttons, and select elements. It is not particularlyuseful for text input because then the event is only fired once focus is lost, meaning that you can use the blur() event instead.	submit()	User feedback forms 	
focus() blur()		But for checkboxes, radio buttons, and select elements, you'll want to use the change event which you can handle using the change() function of course.
